    <h5>Make the Slaw:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together may, pickle juice, and sugar. Stir in shredded cabbage, carrots, and pickles. Stir together and taste. Season to your liking. Slaw can be made a day or two in adcance with no problem.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Prepare the Chicken:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium-high heat. To butterfly the chicken, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken horizontally - leaving the edge connected so you can open the checken breast - making it thinner and therefore faster-cooking. Then drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce into a bowl and set aside. You will add it to the cooked chicken later.</li>
        <li>Add checken to grill and spoon BBQ sauce over each piece of chicken. You will use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce for this part of cooking. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. Flip and add BBQ sauce to the second side. Grill for another 5 to 6 minutes on the second side or until the checken breasts reach 165 degrees F. Remove from the grill.</li>
        <li>As the chicken grills, add 2 to 3 serrano peppers to the grill. Grill them for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove and let cool.</li>
        <li>When the chicken comes off the grill, let it cool briefly and then use two forks to shred or roughly chop the chicken. Stir the 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce you set aside in step 2 into the shredded chicken.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Make the Serrano Mayo:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Split grilled peppers in half and remove seeds. Add to a small food processor with mayo, lime juice, and slat. Pulse until combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Make Your Sandwhich:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your sandwhich buns (if you want to) and smear with serrano mayo. Top with a heap of pickle slaw and shredded BBQ chicken. Serve with chips and pickles on the side. Leftover chicken will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 days or freeze in an airtight container for up to three months.</li>
    </ol>
